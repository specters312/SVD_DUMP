# SVD DUMP

SVD files are kind of hard to come by and companies usually dont want you to have them so if they end up on github they will now be posted here because we will be scanning github from now on. The methods of doing this will only be told to people in person and that we trust sorry :/ but feel free to use whatever is here for your hacking/reversing needs!
